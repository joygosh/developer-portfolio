            <h3>My aim is to become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Human life is dynamic. Therefore,everyone must have a plan to do something. And that is called one's aim
                in life.
                A man without an aim is like a beast. So, everyone should choose a profession which suits him most. In
                choosing
                a profession, one has to be very careful and consderate. Aim differs from man to man. It depends on
                one's taste,
                interest, aptitude and ability. Like others, I have also an aim. My aim is to become a web developer</p>
